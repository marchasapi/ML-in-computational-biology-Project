This project focuses on classifying human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data using various machine learning and deep learning methods.The dataset includes gene expression profiles for 15,928 samples from eight donors, categorized into 75 distinct cell types. Our approach involves several steps: preprocessing the RNA sequencing data, reducing its dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and applying different machine learning algorithms for classification.
We used models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines, validated through nested cross-validation for reliable performance measurement. Metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 Score, Sensitivity, and Precision were used to evaluate the models. Additionally, we built a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model with TensorFlow and Keras, trying various neural network configurations to find the best performance.By comparing the predictions of different models, we ensure a thorough evaluation of their performance. This project combines traditional machine learning with deep learning and provides an efficient framework for classifying snRNA-seq data.
